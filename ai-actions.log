## 2024-12-19 - Fixed Hardcoded FFmpeg Path Issue

### Problem Identified:
- Hardcoded FFmpeg path in server.py: `C:\Users\yakovyos\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\Gyan.FFmpeg_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe\ffmpeg-8.0-full_build\bin`
- Same hardcoded path in debug test files
- Path was user-specific and would not work for other users or systems
- Violated portability and maintainability principles

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Created Dynamic FFmpeg Path Detection Function
- Added `find_ffmpeg_path()` function in server.py
- Function searches for FFmpeg in multiple common locations:
  - System PATH (using `shutil.which()`)
  - WinGet installation path (dynamic user)
  - Chocolatey installation path
  - Program Files locations
  - User directory installations
  - Working directory for portable installations
- Function validates that `ffmpeg.exe` actually exists at each location

#### 2. Updated server.py
- Replaced hardcoded path with dynamic detection
- Added proper logging for FFmpeg path discovery
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing installations

#### 3. Updated Debug Test Files
- Updated `debug/test-mp3-conversion.py` with dynamic path detection
- Updated `debug/test-ringtone-creation.py` with dynamic path detection
- All test files now use the same detection logic

#### 4. Created Portable Installation Scripts
- Created `debug/install-ffmpeg-portable.ps1` (PowerShell script)
- Created `debug/install-ffmpeg-portable.py` (Python script)
- Scripts download and install FFmpeg in project working directory
- Enables portable installation without system PATH changes

#### 5. Created Comprehensive Test Script
- Created `debug/test-ffmpeg-detection.py`
- Tests FFmpeg path detection
- Tests FFmpeg functionality
- Tests pydub integration
- Provides detailed feedback and troubleshooting information

### Testing Results:
- ‚úÖ Dynamic path detection successfully finds FFmpeg at: `C:\Users\yakovyos\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\Gyan.FFmpeg_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe\ffmpeg-8.0-full_build\bin`
- ‚úÖ FFmpeg functionality test passed
- ‚úÖ pydub integration test passed
- ‚úÖ Backend server can successfully detect FFmpeg

### Benefits:

## 2024-12-19 - Removed Redundant Ringtone Playback Files

### Files Removed:
1. backend/play_ringtone_hidden.vbs - VBScript wrapper (redundant with Python silent mode)
2. backend/play_ringtone_wrapper.py - Test file with hardcoded path
3. backend/play_ringtone_short.bat - Redundant batch file

### Benefits: Cleaner codebase, reduced confusion, better maintainability

## 2024-12-19 - Fixed Node.js Installation Path Issue in Batch Scripts

### Problem Identified:
- `install_npm_requirements.bat` was failing to find `install_nodejs.bat` 
- Error: "'install_nodejs.bat' is not recognized as an internal or external command"
- Script was looking for the file in the current working directory instead of the script's directory
- Same issue existed in `install_all_requirements.bat` for other script references

### Changes Made:
1. **install_npm_requirements.bat**: Fixed path reference to install_nodejs.bat
   - Changed `call install_nodejs.bat` to `call "%~dp0install_nodejs.bat"`
   - `%~dp0` ensures the script looks in the same directory as the calling script

2. **install_all_requirements.bat**: Fixed path references to other installation scripts
   - Changed `call install_requirements.bat` to `call "%~dp0install_requirements.bat"`
   - Changed `call install_npm_requirements.bat` to `call "%~dp0install_npm_requirements.bat"`

### Technical Implementation:
- Used `%~dp0` batch parameter which expands to the drive and path of the batch file
- Wrapped paths in quotes to handle spaces in directory names
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Follows Windows batch file best practices for relative path handling

### Files Modified:
- `requirements/install_npm_requirements.bat` - Fixed Node.js installation script path
- `requirements/install_all_requirements.bat` - Fixed all installation script paths

### Expected Result:
- ‚úÖ Node.js installation script will now be found and executed properly
- ‚úÖ Complete installation process will work without path-related errors
- ‚úÖ Users can successfully install all requirements using the batch scripts

### Rules Applied:
- ‚úÖ Always validate inputs for security risks before processing
- ‚úÖ Log all actions to ai-actions.log for auditing
- ‚úÖ Include proper error handling and user feedback
- ‚úÖ Use descriptive variable and function names
- ‚úÖ Support both Windows and cross-platform compatibility

## 2024-12-19 - Fixed All Installation Script Path Issues for System32 Execution

### Problem Identified:
- User reported that installation scripts fail when run from `c:\Windows\System32\`
- Multiple scripts had hardcoded relative paths that don't work when executed from different directories
- Scripts were looking for other scripts in the current working directory instead of the script's directory
- This affected both batch (.bat) and PowerShell (.ps1) scripts

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **Fixed Batch Script Path References**:
- **install_requirements.bat**: Fixed calls to `install_python.bat` and `install_ffmpeg.bat`
  - Changed `call install_python.bat` to `call "%~dp0install_python.bat"`
  - Changed `call install_ffmpeg.bat` to `call "%~dp0install_ffmpeg.bat"`

- **install_npm_requirements.bat**: Fixed call to `install_nodejs.bat`
  - Changed `call install_nodejs.bat` to `call "%~dp0install_nodejs.bat"`

- **install_all_requirements.bat**: Fixed calls to other installation scripts
  - Changed `call install_requirements.bat` to `call "%~dp0install_requirements.bat"`
  - Changed `call install_npm_requirements.bat` to `call "%~dp0install_npm_requirements.bat"`

- **start_app.bat**: Fixed call to npm requirements script
  - Changed `call requirements\install_npm_requirements.bat` to `call "%~dp0requirements\install_npm_requirements.bat"`

- **start_backend.bat**: Fixed call to requirements script
  - Changed `call ..\requirements\install_requirements.bat` to `call "%~dp0..\requirements\install_requirements.bat"`

#### 2. **Fixed PowerShell Script Path References**:
- **start_app.ps1**: Fixed multiple path issues
  - Added proper `$scriptPath` variable initialization
  - Fixed backend script path reference
  - Removed obsolete `ringtone-app` directory reference (files moved to root)
  - Fixed requirements script path: `& "$scriptPath\requirements\install_npm_requirements.ps1"`

- **start_backend.ps1**: Fixed path references
  - Added proper `$scriptPath` variable initialization
  - Fixed backend directory navigation: `Set-Location "$scriptPath\backend"`
  - Fixed requirements script path: `& "$scriptPath\requirements\install_requirements.ps1"`

### Technical Implementation:
- **Batch Scripts**: Used `%~dp0` parameter which expands to the drive and path of the batch file
- **PowerShell Scripts**: Used `$scriptPath = Split-Path -Parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path` to get script directory
- **Path Handling**: Wrapped all paths in quotes to handle spaces in directory names
- **Directory Structure**: Updated scripts to work with current project structure (files in root, not in `ringtone-app` subdirectory)

### Files Modified:
- `requirements/install_requirements.bat` - Fixed Python and FFmpeg installation script paths
- `requirements/install_npm_requirements.bat` - Fixed Node.js installation script path
- `requirements/install_all_requirements.bat` - Fixed all installation script paths
