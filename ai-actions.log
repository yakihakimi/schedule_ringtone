## 2024-12-19 - Fixed Hardcoded FFmpeg Path Issue

### Problem Identified:
- Hardcoded FFmpeg path in server.py: `C:\Users\yakovyos\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\Gyan.FFmpeg_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe\ffmpeg-8.0-full_build\bin`
- Same hardcoded path in debug test files
- Path was user-specific and would not work for other users or systems
- Violated portability and maintainability principles

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Created Dynamic FFmpeg Path Detection Function
- Added `find_ffmpeg_path()` function in server.py
- Function searches for FFmpeg in multiple common locations:
  - System PATH (using `shutil.which()`)
  - WinGet installation path (dynamic user)
  - Chocolatey installation path
  - Program Files locations
  - User directory installations
  - Working directory for portable installations
- Function validates that `ffmpeg.exe` actually exists at each location

#### 2. Updated server.py
- Replaced hardcoded path with dynamic detection
- Added proper logging for FFmpeg path discovery
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing installations

#### 3. Updated Debug Test Files
- Updated `debug/test-mp3-conversion.py` with dynamic path detection
- Updated `debug/test-ringtone-creation.py` with dynamic path detection
- All test files now use the same detection logic

#### 4. Created Portable Installation Scripts
- Created `debug/install-ffmpeg-portable.ps1` (PowerShell script)
- Created `debug/install-ffmpeg-portable.py` (Python script)
- Scripts download and install FFmpeg in project working directory
- Enables portable installation without system PATH changes

#### 5. Created Comprehensive Test Script
- Created `debug/test-ffmpeg-detection.py`
- Tests FFmpeg path detection
- Tests FFmpeg functionality
- Tests pydub integration
- Provides detailed feedback and troubleshooting information

### Testing Results:
- ‚úÖ Dynamic path detection successfully finds FFmpeg at: `C:\Users\yakovyos\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\Gyan.FFmpeg_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe\ffmpeg-8.0-full_build\bin`
- ‚úÖ FFmpeg functionality test passed
- ‚úÖ pydub integration test passed
- ‚úÖ Backend server can successfully detect FFmpeg

### Benefits:
- **Portability**: Works on any system with FFmpeg installed
- **Maintainability**: No more hardcoded user-specific paths
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple installation methods
- **User-friendly**: Automatic detection with fallback options
- **Compliance**: Follows project rules for dynamic path handling

### Files Modified:
- `backend/server.py` - Added dynamic FFmpeg detection
- `debug/test-mp3-conversion.py` - Updated with dynamic detection
- `debug/test-ringtone-creation.py` - Updated with dynamic detection

### Files Created:
